/// Builds the LOD cache from terrain the world already has, by loading chunk columns that
/// were generated in some earlier session.
///
/// This is the cheap half of pre-generation and the one worth having on by default. A
/// savegame accumulates terrain for as long as anyone plays, while the LOD cache only ever
/// saw the fraction that happened to stream past a player running this mod - measured on a
/// test world at 12,632 generated columns against 620 captured sections, and a world played
/// for weeks skews far harder than that. All of it is already on disk, already paid for.
///
/// The distinction from pre-generation (<see cref="LodPlayerPregen"/>) is the whole
/// point: that creates terrain nobody has visited, and reveals places no player has
/// been. Sweeping creates nothing. It indexes what exists, so it is safe to default on
/// where pre-generation is not.
///
/// Keeping that promise takes more than checking the target column, which is what the first
/// version did and why this does two passes now. Loading a column whose surroundings are
/// absent makes the engine generate them, because worldgen runs in passes and finishing one
/// column requires its neighbours to have reached an earlier pass - which requires theirs.
/// A one-pass sweep of 8,464 existing columns added 1,460 brand new ones to the savegame.
/// Sweeping the same world with a radius that fell entirely inside generated terrain added
/// exactly zero, which is what identified the cause as the frontier rather than the loads.
///
/// So: probe everything first, then load only columns whose whole neighbourhood is already
/// on disk. The cost is a border of real terrain going uncaptured, which for any world worth
/// sweeping is a rounding error against not generating anything at all.

/// Builds the LOD cache around a player on request (/vhgen), including terrain that
/// nobody has generated.
///
/// Three phases. PROBE asks the engine which columns exist, exactly as the sweep does.
/// WORK walks the same spiral and acts on <see cref="LodColumnMap.Classify"/>: columns
/// that exist load through the normal capture path, and columns that do not exist are
/// PEEKED - PeekChunkColumn runs real worldgen from the seed and hands the column back
/// without writing the savegame or the loaded chunk list. VERIFY then re-probes a
/// sample of positions that were absent, because "a peek persists nothing" is a promise
/// this mod makes to server admins, and a promise gets measured, not trusted.
///
/// Peeked columns reach capture through <see cref="LodPipeline.CaptureColumn"/>. The
/// BlockAccessor cannot see a peeked column, so the ChunkColumnLoaded path that serves
/// the sweep never fires for them.
///
/// Measured constants come from TopoHorizon (MIT, (c) 2026 Jack Brown), confirmed on
/// this engine build where noted: a Terrain-pass peek returns a 1x1 area with the rain
/// height map populated (confirmed), the callback lands on the main thread (confirmed),
/// serial peeks cost ~250ms issue-to-callback here and saturate near 23/s. The
/// stuck-peek timeout is TopoHorizon's 300s - their 60s value produced 60-70% false
/// timeouts under load.
///
/// The Vegetation pass is deliberately not offered. It throws NullReferenceException
/// inside vanilla worldgen (ForestFloorSystem.CreateForestFloor and
/// BlockFruitTreeBranch.TryPlaceBlockForWorldGen) unless a Harmony finalizer swallows
/// it, and this mod ships no Harmony patches. Generated terrain therefore has no
/// trees. Real capture overwrites it whenever a player actually visits.

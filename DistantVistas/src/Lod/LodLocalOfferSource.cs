/// The server side's cache, read by the client side of the same singleplayer world.

/// A savegame sweep can only run on the server side, because only it can ask for chunk
/// columns the player is nowhere near. But the server has no texture atlas, so what it
/// captures is geometry with every palette colour left at zero. The client has the atlas
/// and cannot reach the columns. Each half holds exactly what the other is missing.
///
/// So the swept sections travel the same road as sections fetched from a real server: they
/// arrive colourless, get recoloured from their block codes on install, and land in the
/// client's own cache. LodRemoteKeySet does not care whether a blob came off a socket or
/// off the disk beside it, which is why this is a reader and not a subsystem.
///
/// Deliberately NOT a LodStore. That class creates tables and can delete rows whose format
/// version it does not recognise, and pointing it at a file another pipeline has open for
/// writing is a good way to find out what SQLite does about two writers. This only ever
/// reads, and says so in the connection string.

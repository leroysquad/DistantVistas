/// received, so anything that stopped the fill-in from happening was written to disk and
/// stayed there. That happened: a block code that failed to resolve used to be cached as
/// a failure for the rest of the session, so once a common code lost that race, every
/// foreign section installed afterwards was saved with its colours still at zero. Measured
/// on a real cache afterwards - 7 sections entirely uncoloured and 59 partly, on ordinary
/// ground like soil-low-normal, rock-slate and tallgrass-medium-free.
///
/// Zero is a safe sentinel for "never coloured". It is fully transparent black, which no
/// real block averages to, and it is exactly what the writer stores when it cannot answer.
///
/// Fixing the cause only helps caches that do not exist yet, so this runs over every
/// section as it loads and repairs what is already on disk.

/// Measures what a Terrain-pass peek produces, against two references.
///
/// EXPERIMENT A (/vhgen diff) compares a peek against a full generation of the same
/// coordinates. This is the record behind the "generated terrain is missing things"
/// caveat. The caveat used to say "no trees", which came from reading the
/// EnumWorldGenPass doc comments rather than from measurement - the same method that
/// under-reported the sweep's neighbour dependency by three rings. The passes a peek
/// skips also carry ores, worldgen structures, above-sealevel lakes, hot springs,
/// shrubs, rivulets and the snow layer, so the report lists what is actually absent
/// instead of naming one example.
///
/// EXPERIMENT B (/vhgen edittest) places a marker block, reads it back from the loaded
/// world, then peeks the same coordinate and looks for it there. This is the evidence
/// behind LodColumnMap.Classify never peeking a column that exists. The rule is
/// currently justified by the API contract - PeekChunkColumn generates "from scratch
/// without keeping it in the list of loaded chunks", so a peek and the savegame are
/// two independent generations - and by a fast-tier assertion over a HashSet. Neither
/// demonstrates that a peek really loses an edit.
///
/// Both experiments read blocks directly rather than through LodPipeline. The question
/// is what worldgen produced, so the palette remapping the capture path performs sits
/// between us and the answer. The walk is LodWorker.Capture's own idiom and works
/// identically for a peeked IServerChunk[] and a loaded one.

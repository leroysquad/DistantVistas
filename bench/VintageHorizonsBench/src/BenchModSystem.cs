/// Drives a fixed route and records what each LOD mod does with it.
///
/// The point is like-for-like comparison: the same world, the same waypoints, the same
/// camera angles, the same time of day and weather, with only the mod under test
/// changed. Anything that varies run to run makes the numbers and the screenshots
/// incomparable, so this harness pins all of it.
///
/// It deliberately does NOT judge image quality. It produces frame-time statistics for
/// the numbers, and one screenshot per waypoint per mod for a human to compare
/// side by side.
///
/// Enabled only when VHBENCH_ROUTE is set:
///   VHBENCH_ROUTE   path to a route file (see routes/*.txt)
///   VHBENCH_LABEL   name of the configuration under test, used in output filenames
///   VHBENCH_OUT     output directory (default: &lt;dataPath&gt;/bench)
///   VHBENCH_SETTLE  MINIMUM seconds to wait at each waypoint before measuring (default 20)
///   VHBENCH_SETTLE_MAX  give up waiting for stability after this many seconds (default 90)
///   VHBENCH_MEASURE seconds to measure at each waypoint (default 10)
///   VHBENCH_LAPS    MEASURED laps of the route, aggregated per waypoint (default 1)
///   VHBENCH_WARMUP_LAPS  laps walked first and thrown away (default 1)
///
/// On settling, and why it is not a fixed sleep. A teleport starts a burst of streaming,
/// capture, meshing and upload, and how long that burst lasts depends on the mod, the
/// waypoint and what is already cached. A fixed timer either cuts into the burst or
/// wastes time after it, and the first of those is worse: it measures loading, not
/// drawing, and it does so by an amount that varies run to run.
///
/// So settling watches the frame times themselves and waits for them to stop moving.
/// That criterion needs to know nothing about the mod under test, which matters because
/// this harness also runs against Farseer and against no LOD mod at all.
///
/// On laps. One visit to a waypoint is one sample, and a 1% low drawn from ~1500 frames
/// is the mean of the worst 15, which moves a lot. Walking the route several times and
/// taking the median across laps costs wall clock and buys the ability to tell a real
/// change from noise. The spread across laps is written into the CSV as well, so the
/// noise floor is visible in every result rather than needing a separate experiment.
///
/// On the warm-up lap, and why laps are not simply averaged. The first lap loads the
/// world: it captures, meshes and uploads terrain that every later lap then finds
/// already there. Measured, the first lap ran several times slower than the second at
/// every waypoint, so averaging across laps blends two different regimes and the spread
/// that comes out measures the warm-up rather than the noise. The first lap or two are
/// therefore walked and discarded, and only the steady-state laps are aggregated.

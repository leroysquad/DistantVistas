# The label names the configuration under test and appears in every output filename, so
# results from different mods sit side by side in one directory:
#   .testdata/bench/<label>.csv        frame timings per waypoint
#   .testdata/bench/<label>--<wp>.png  one screenshot per waypoint
#
# Comparisons are only meaningful if the world, route, settle and measure times are
# identical across runs -- change one of those and previously recorded results no longer
# compare. The harness mod pins time of day, weather and camera angles for the same
# reason.
#
# Server-side mods: Farseer and ChunkLOD are 'Universal' and required on both sides, so
# they need --server-mods as well as --mods. VintageHorizons never does.

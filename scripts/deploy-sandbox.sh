# Build the mod and install it into the sandbox at .testdata/Mods.
#
# This step used to be manual, which meant a sandbox run could silently measure a
# binary from some earlier session. bench.sh only ever did it as a side effect of
# wiping mod directories for its own comparison, so a plain (non-bench) run had no
# way to get a fresh build in at all.
#
# Usage: deploy-sandbox.sh [client|server|both]   (default: client)
#
# The server side is deliberately NOT the default: most testing wants a strictly
# vanilla dedicated server, to prove the mod works as a client-side-only install.
# Ask for it explicitly when testing the server assist.

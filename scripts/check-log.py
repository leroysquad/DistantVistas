"""Assert on what a sandbox run actually logged.

The mod reports its whole internal state through a handful of format strings whose
shape is stable, so a run's logs are a machine-readable record of what the pipeline
did. That is what makes the sandbox tiers assertable rather than just watchable.

Every claim in DESIGN.md and notes/STATUS.md was originally established by reading
these same numbers off a screen by hand, once. This reads them every time.

Usage:
    check-log.py <client-main.log> [options]

Options are assertions; with none, only the universal invariants are checked.

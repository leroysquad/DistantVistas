# only addition, lets it capture for a while, stops cleanly, and asserts on what the
# logs say happened. Then restarts against the warm cache, which is the only way to
# check that what was written can be read back.

# Everything here goes through the existing test-*.sh isolation plumbing unchanged.
# Those rules are safety-critical - a violation once crashed the user's live game -

# Sandboxed Vintage Story CLIENT for VintageHorizons testing.
#
# Isolation guarantees (all of them matter - see notes/STATUS.md "test isolation"):
#  - Own dataPath (.testdata): never touches the user's real game data.
#  - Own TMPDIR: the game's single-instance pipe (CoreFxPipe_SingleInstance
#    VintageStoryWithUriScheme) lives in $TMPDIR. Without this, launching with
#    -c FORWARDS the connect request into whatever VS instance is already
#    running - including the user's personal game - and exits silently.
#  - PID from $! in a pidfile, and every stop verifies /proc/<pid>/cmdline names
#    the sandbox before signalling. Stop ONLY via scripts/test-stop.sh; never
#    locate test instances by process name or argument matching.
#
# Env knobs pass through: VINTAGEHORIZONS_AUTOUNPAUSE, VINTAGEHORIZONS_AUTOEXPLORE,
# VINTAGEHORIZONS_EXPLORE_HOP. Extra args (e.g. -c localhost:42425, -o world) are
# forwarded to the game - pass ABSOLUTE paths, since the game runs with its
# install dir as cwd. Console output: .testdata/launch.log (previous run kept as
# launch.log.prev).

# Distant Vistas

Distant Horizons-style extended render distance for [Vintage Story](https://www.vintagestory.at/).
It works on any server, and that server needs nothing installed.

Other VS LOD mods (Farseer, ChunkLOD) must be on the server. This one needs no server
install. It builds a persistent level-of-detail cache from the chunk data that your
client already receives as you play. It then draws that cache far past the normal view
distance. Coverage grows as you explore, and it persists across sessions.

You can also install it on your server. Then it shares its own cache with players and an
admin can build the horizon on request. A server install makes the matching client mod
required, so Vintage Story downloads it for joining players. A client-only install still
works on servers that do not run the mod.

## What it does

- **Unlimited render distance**, decoupled from the vanilla view-distance slider.
- **Real 3D terrain**, not a heightmap. Mountains, overhangs, cave mouths, forests, and
  anything you build all appear at distance, at 1-block resolution near the player.
- **Translucent water**, drawn over the lake and sea floors beneath it.
- **Live seasonal colour**. Grass and foliage follow the game's own climate and season
  maps. The mod derives a snow line from the local temperature lapse rate. So the far
  terrain changes with the seasons. It does not keep the colours it had at capture time.
- **Persistent per-world cache** that grows as you play. Join time and memory use do not
  depend on the size of the explored area.

## What it cannot do

A client-side mod knows only the terrain that the server sent it. Land that you never
came near never reached your client. It is not in the cache, so the mod cannot draw it.
A new world therefore shows nothing past the vanilla view distance until you travel.

Server-side generators (Farseer, ChunkLOD) ask the world generator directly and do not
have this limit. In exchange, those mods must be on the server.

In this mod, the edge of the explored area fades into the horizon. It does not end in a
cliff. The picture fills in the more you play. If you run the server, `/vhgen` builds it
in advance.

## In-game commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.vhinfo` | Status: cached/resident sections, meshes, current far edge, settings |
| `.vhdetail [blocks]` | Distance before detail starts to halve (default 512). A higher value gives sharper far terrain and costs more VRAM and CPU. Try 1024. Without an argument, the command reports the current value. |
| `.vhfar <blocks>` | Cap the LOD render distance. `0` means unlimited, which is the default. |
| `.vhdefer [on\|off]` | Stay idle when another LOD mod draws (on by default). A change applies at the next start, not at once. |

### If your server runs Farseer, ChunkLOD or TopoHorizon

The client must have those mods, so the game installs one on your machine when you join
such a server. If two LOD mods draw at the same time, they fight over the camera far
plane and draw over each other. So this mod stays idle while another mod **draws**.

An installed mod does not always draw. Switch Farseer off in its own dialog
(Ctrl+Shift+F). This mod then draws by itself, and there is nothing else to set. For the
mods whose switch this one cannot read, `.vhdefer off` makes it draw anyway. Then switch
the other mod off as well, or the two will draw over the same ground.

**Restart the game after either change.** The mod decides which one draws once, at
startup, before a world exists. If you switch the other mod off while you play, nothing
changes until the next start.

`.vhinfo` names the mod that this one defers to.

Two server commands exist as well (`/`, not `.`). They need the controlserver
privilege, which every singleplayer host has:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/vhserver` | Server assist status: settings in force, cache size, transfer counters |
| `/vhgen start [radius] [x z]` | Build the LOD cache around you (or around `x z`). It generates terrain that nobody visited yet. Also `stop` and `status`. See below. |

Both settings persist in `VintagestoryData/ModConfig/distantvistas.json`.
The per-world cache lives in `VintagestoryData/ModData/distantvistas/<savegame-id>.db`.
When an update changes what the stored data means, the mod discards that cache. A stale
cache can therefore never degrade a newer version.

## Building

Requires the .NET 10 SDK and a Vintage Story 1.22.5 or 1.22.6 install. Those are the two
versions the check suite runs on. The mod declares 1.22.5 as its minimum, so it will not
load on anything older.

```sh
export VINTAGE_STORY="$HOME/Games/vintagestory1.22.5"   # your game path
dotnet build DistantVistas
```

The build assembles a loadable mod folder at `DistantVistas/bin/Debug/net10.0/Mods/distantvistas`.
`scripts/package.sh` produces a ModDB-ready zip in `dist/`.

```sh
scripts/dev-run.sh              # opens/creates the "vhsurvival" test world
scripts/dev-run.sh myworld      # a different world
```

### Savegame sweeping

A savegame holds every chunk column that anyone ever generated. The LOD cache saw only
the part that streamed past a player who ran this mod. The sweep loads those columns so
that capture sees them. You get a horizon over every place that you visited before, and
you do not fly back over it.

Sweeping is on by default, in singleplayer too. The settings are `SweepSavegame`,
`SweepRadiusChunks` and `SweepColumnsPerSecond`, in
`ModConfig/distantvistas-server.json`.

The default is safe because the sweep **generates nothing**. The sweep skips a position
that nobody visited. It also skips a border around the explored terrain, because a
load there makes the engine generate the missing neighbours.

`PregenRadiusChunks` takes the opposite trade. It creates terrain that nobody visited yet, so
it stays off unless an admin asks for it. That setting now uses the same transient
generation `/vhgen` uses, so it too writes nothing to the savegame.

### Generating the horizon (/vhgen)

Sweeping and capture cover only terrain that exists. `/vhgen start [radius] [x z]` covers
the rest. It builds the LOD picture around you, or around coordinates you give, for land
that nobody visited yet. It writes **nothing** to the savegame.

The engine's `PeekChunkColumn` runs real worldgen from the seed and returns the column
transiently. The mod captures it and throws the terrain away. A column that already
exists loads normally instead, so player builds stay correct.

Every run then re-probes a sample of the positions that it generated. It reports the
result on its finish line, as "Verified 256/256 sampled absent positions still absent".
The check regimen also asserts the savegame promise byte for byte, but only against
vanilla worldgen. The runtime check is what watches it on a modded server.

**Generated terrain is bare.** It carries the landform, the rock strata, caves, rivers,
and the soil and sand on top. Nothing else. A comparison with a full generation of the
same column shows that a peek misses 67 block types. The missing types are snow, ore,
cave dressing, surface boulders, small water, worldgen ruins with their contents, and
trees in a forested column.

What a peek produces is never wrong. Nothing appears in a peek that a real generation
does not also make. So generated terrain reads as a correct but plain version of itself,
and real capture fills in the rest the first time a player visits. `/vhgen diff` prints
the measurement for your own world.

It stops there because the pass that adds trees crashes vanilla worldgen when it runs
this way. The fix is a patch this mod does not ship.

A client that is already connected learns about new sections at its next join, not live.

The command needs the controlserver privilege. Five settings bound it in the server
config: `EnableGenerateCommand`, `GenerateMaxRadiusChunks` (the ceiling, default 128),
`GenerateDefaultRadiusChunks`, `GenerateColumnsPerSecond` and `GenerateMaxInFlight`.

### Running the checks

```sh
scripts/check.sh              # all three tiers, in order (~25 min)
scripts/check.sh fast         # pure logic and static assets, no game (~30 s)
scripts/check.sh smoke        # one end-to-end sandbox run (~5 min)
scripts/check.sh matrix       # install combinations and admin controls (~20 min)
```

Run `fast` constantly. It needs no game process, and after the first build it finishes in
less than a second. Run all three tiers before you commit.

The three tiers answer different questions.

`fast` covers the pure logic: key packing, the RLE column store, mip downsampling, and
the mesher's greedy merge and coverage rules. The blob format, frustum planes and config
clamps are in it too. It also covers the invariants that span files, which no compiler can catch. One
example is the shader's `TINT_SLOTS` matching `LodTintRegistry.MaxSlots`.

`smoke` starts a vanilla dedicated server and a sandboxed client, then asserts on what the
run logged. It includes a second pass against the warm cache. That pass is the only way
to know that the client can read back what it wrote.

`matrix` covers the configurations that other people put the mod in. It runs a vanilla
server, a modded one, and a client without the mod at all. It also tests each admin
switch. Two scenarios cover competing LOD mods, in both directions: `deferral` proves
that we yield to one that draws, and `farseer-off` proves that we do not yield to one
that the player switched off.

**There is no CI, and there cannot be.** Building this repo requires the Vintage Story
assemblies from a local game install, and those are not redistributable, so no hosted
runner can compile it. `scripts/check.sh` is the entire safety net.

### Testing without touching your own game

Test instances run in a `.testdata` sandbox and must be started and stopped only through
these scripts:

```sh
scripts/test-server.sh                              # vanilla dedicated server, port 42425
scripts/test-client.sh -c localhost:42425           # sandboxed client
scripts/test-stop.sh [client|server|all]            # stop via pidfiles
```

CAUTION: Start and stop test instances only with these scripts. The VS client allows one
instance, through a named pipe in `$TMPDIR`. A launch with `-c` **forwards its connect
request into whatever instance is already running**, including your own game, and then
exits without a message.

`--dataPath` does not protect you. A private `TMPDIR` does, and these scripts set one up.
They also record the child PID, and they make sure that `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` names the
sandbox before they signal anything. Without that step, a stale pidfile and a reused PID
together kill an unrelated process.

Useful env variables for unattended runs: `VINTAGEHORIZONS_AUTOUNPAUSE=1` (game ticks
continue without window focus), `VINTAGEHORIZONS_AUTOEXPLORE=1` and
`VINTAGEHORIZONS_EXPLORE_HOP=<blocks>` (teleport along a spiral so that fresh chunks
stream in).

### Development notes

- **Shaders must be pure ASCII** (even comments). The engine's OpenTK marshaling
  truncates the GL source by the difference between UTF-8 bytes and char count,
  which silently cuts the end off the shader.
- Worlds created via `-o` default to the `creativebuilding` playstyle, which is
  **superflat** - the dev script passes the `preset-surviveandbuild` lang code for real
  terrain.
- Singleplayer pauses while the game window is unfocused, which stops game ticks - and
  with them LOD ingestion and cache saves.
- The game's block registry must not be read off the main thread (`GetBlock(int)` lazily
  mutates a dictionary). Sections deserialized on the storage thread keep their palette
  block *codes* and have ids resolved at install time on the main thread.

## [Unreleased]

**Fixed: chiselled blocks drew as one flat wrong colour in the distance.** Reported as
purple. A chiselled block's colour lives in its block entity, and only a probe at the
block's exact position finds it - the world map colours chisel work the same way. The
LOD colour probe asked at a stand-in position, the centre of the chunk column, found no
block entity there, and fell through to the placeholder texture. So every chisel in a
section took the placeholder's colour. The probe now uses the block's own position, and
distant chisel work takes the materials it is made of. Chiselled terrain that came from
a server or from transient generation has no block entity to read. That now draws a
neutral grey instead of the placeholder colour. Ground already cached with the wrong
colour corrects itself when you visit it again.

**Fixed: reloading a singleplayer world crashed with "cache file not writable".** When
you left a world, the mod parked an open handle to the server-side cache in a connection
pool. The handle lived as long as the game process. On the next load of the same world,
the integrated server failed to open its own cache file. On platforms whose file sharing
blocks a writer while any handle is open, this failed every time. 0.1.0 had no
server-side cache, so this fault did not exist there. The mod now closes the handle,
and a check watches the process's handle table so that this stays true.

**Fixed: Vistas Beyond no longer switches this mod off.** Vistas Beyond was on the list
of LOD mods that this one defers to, a guess made from its name. It does not belong
there: it is a server-side worldgen mod that adjusts terrain generation and draws
nothing, so there is no conflict to avoid. The two together now give exactly what that
pairing promises: more dramatic terrain, visible from further away. Reported from the
field.

**Fixed: patches of distant terrain were solid black, and stayed black.** A server has
no texture atlas, so it stores no colour, and the client adds the colour on arrival. The
client also saves what it receives. So anything that stopped the colour step went to the
cache without colour and stayed there. That ground drew as pure black for as long as
that world existed.

What stopped it was a block code that failed to resolve. The mod kept that answer for
the rest of the session, and the lookup runs while a world still starts. So when one
common block lost that race, every section saved after it had no colour at all. The
measurement on a real world found 7 sections with no colour anywhere and 59 more in
patches, on ground as ordinary as soil, slate and tall grass.

The mod no longer keeps a failed lookup, and tries the code again instead. Sections that
were saved without colour get their colour from the texture atlas as they load, and the
mod writes them back. So a cache repairs itself as you play, and nothing is discarded. A
block that this game does not have now draws as plain grey, and the log names both the
count and the block codes. A black patch with no explanation cannot occur again.

**Fixed: joining a server before its cache existed switched the assist off for the whole
session.** The server reported the assist as "off" whenever its cache was empty at the
instant you joined. An empty cache is the ordinary state of a fresh server, and of any
server just before an admin runs `/vhgen`. The client took that answer as final and
ignored everything that the server sent afterwards. No amount of generation helped until
you relogged. The answer now says whether the server *will* serve, not whether it holds
anything at that second, and a server with nothing yet says so plainly.

**Fixed: a server cache that grew while you were online never reached you.** The server
sent its list of sections once, when you joined, and never again. A client only requests
sections that the server offered. So an admin who ran `/vhgen` while people played built
terrain that none of them had a way to request. `.vhwhy` reported `no-data` for ground
that the server held for hours, and a relog was the only cure. A sweep that finished
late did the same, and so did other players who explored. The server now offers what it
gained every few seconds, and `/vhserver` reports how many of those follow-up offers it
sent.

**Fixed: another LOD mod that is switched off no longer switches this one off too.**
0.2.0 went idle whenever Farseer, ChunkLOD, Vistas Beyond or TopoHorizon was loaded. On a server that
runs one of those, the game makes every client load it, and downloads it for you. So
"loaded" never meant "drawing". A player who switched Farseer off in its own dialog and
used this mod instead got no distant terrain from either mod.

This mod now reads Farseer's own switch, in `farseer-client.json`, and draws when
Farseer is off. There is nothing to configure: the setting is already on disk. For the
mods whose switch this mod cannot read, it still defers. `IgnoreOtherLodMods` in
`vintagehorizons.json` overrides that, and `.vhdefer on|off` sets it from chat. A change
applies at the next start, never in the middle of a session.

`.vhinfo` and the log line no longer tell you to remove the other mod. That is advice
that a player on such a server cannot obey.

**Fixed: an idle client made the game log a channel warning.** The deferral path
returned before it registered the network channel. The game then reported "Server sends
me channel name vintagehorizons, but no client side mod registered it" at every join.

**Fixed: a crashing client cleaned up almost nothing.** When the game crashed during its
own shutdown, our teardown ran off the main thread, where the engine refuses these
calls, and each refusal skipped every step behind it. That cost the storage writer's
shutdown, and then, once that was guarded, the release of every GPU mesh. Each step now
stands alone, and our own work runs before the engine calls that can refuse.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-03

**Chunk generation on request**, with `/vhgen start [radius] [x z]`. It builds the LOD
picture around a player, or around coordinates you give, for terrain nobody has visited.
It writes nothing to the savegame. Real worldgen runs transiently from the seed, through
the engine's `PeekChunkColumn`. A column that already exists loads normally instead, so
player builds stay correct.

The command needs the controlserver privilege, which every singleplayer host has. Config
ceilings and rate caps bound it. Generated terrain has no trees until a real visit
replaces it. Give both coordinates or neither: the command refuses one on its own, rather
than centring somewhere you did not ask for.

**The non-destructive promise is now measured, twice.** Every sweep and every generation
run re-probes sampled positions that did not exist before it. Each run then prints the
result, as "Verified 256/256 sampled absent positions still absent". So a worldgen mod
that breaks the promise is detected on the server where it happens, and not only in this
repo's test matrix. The check regimen also asserts, byte for byte, that an all-peek run
leaves the savegame's terrain tables identical.

The sample keeps clear of online players, because the engine generates terrain around a
player as ordinary play. A run centred on a player therefore still measures something,
instead of reporting "Verified 0/0".

**Fixed: a client can stop receiving terrain for the rest of a session.** A server
dropped queued section requests without answering them, in two places. The first was
when its cache was not open yet. The second was when a client asked for more than the
queue holds.

A client marks a key in flight when it asks, and forgets it only when a reply arrives. So
a dropped key was stranded. Sixteen of them filled the in-flight cap and blocked every
later request. The server now refuses out loud in both cases, and `/vhserver` counts the
refusals. This fits an intermittent stall seen in testing. It was never caught with
logging in place, so treat it as a defect fixed and not as a diagnosis confirmed.

**Fixed: a bad config file destroyed your settings.** A file that failed to parse was
overwritten with defaults, which deleted every hand-edited setting over one stray comma.
The file is now left untouched, the error names the problem, and defaults apply for that
session only.

**Also fixed.** The client now notices a server-side cache that appears mid-session, from
a sweep after a slow start or from a `/vhgen` run. Before, it looked once at join and
never again. The cache-format purge also reports how many sections it discards, instead
of deleting them in silence.

**Stays out of the way of other LOD mods.** With Farseer, ChunkLOD, Vistas Beyond or
TopoHorizon loaded, this mod now goes idle. Two LOD mods would fight for the camera far
plane and draw over each other. A server that runs one of those forces it onto every
client, while this mod stays optional, so this is the one that yields. `.vhinfo`
reports the idle state and names the mod it defers to.

**Optional server-side assist.** The mod is now Universal, with both
`requiredOnClient` and `requiredOnServer` false. Install it only on your client and it
works exactly as before, on any server, vanilla included.

Install it on the server too and it builds its own LOD cache from everyone's travels. It
then shares that cache with connecting clients on request. A fresh join, or a fresh area,
can therefore already be far. Before, it showed only what that one player had explored.

Server admins get `ModConfig/vintagehorizons-server.json` and a `/vhserver` status
command. The settings cover capture on and off, serving on and off, a serve radius per
player, and rate caps. Serving defaults on, at an 8192-block radius per player.

**Savegame sweeping**, on by default. A server now loads terrain the world generated in
past sessions, so the cache can be built from it at once. Before, the cache grew only
from terrain a player walked past again. Sweeping never generates new terrain. This
covers a dedicated server and singleplayer's own integrated server.

**Pre-generation**, separate and off by default. `PregenRadiusChunks` builds the cache
around spawn at startup, over terrain nobody has visited yet. A server can therefore offer
a horizon on the first join, instead of one that appears over weeks of play.

It now runs the same transient generation `/vhgen` uses. It costs worldgen time but **no
disk**, because the terrain is captured and thrown away. Earlier in this release it loaded
columns instead, which cost a few hundred MB at radius 64. It stays opt-in because it
still reveals map nobody has explored.

**Faster terrain fill-in.** Meshing runs on a thread pool. Before, one thread did capture
and meshing in lockstep, and exploring new terrain starved the mesher. Measured 2-3.5x
faster fill-in at the same load.

**Fixed:**
- LOD regions got permanently stuck coarse, with a hard, unmoving edge between detailed
  and blocky terrain. A wrong "does the server have this" check misfired on ancestor keys.
- LOD colour sometimes resolved to the wrong texture, on a block whose first texture has
  no baked colour. Confirmed on vanilla `fruitingbush-wild-blackberry`, and reported
  against a modded world.
- A false "discarding your cache" message appeared on every new install.
- Singleplayer ran two redundant copies of the whole pipeline in one process.
- Remote terrain now arrives nearest-to-you first, instead of in an arbitrary order.

**Internally**, a repeatable check suite (`scripts/check.sh`) now backs the correctness
claims. Before, each one rested on a hand-run sandbox session.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-25

0.1.0 shipped without the LICENSE in the zip. A review afterwards found three defects.
Ground-cover mats floated on mip-merged runs. Thin plants hid water, so shorelines
showed through. And an unbounded scheduler loop turned one frame into a six-figure scan.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-25

Initial release. Unlimited render distance, decoupled from the vanilla view-distance
slider. Real 3D terrain, not a heightmap: mountains, overhangs, cave mouths, forests, and
player builds all appear at distance. Translucent water over lake and sea floors. Live
seasonal colour and a derived snow line. Persistent per-world cache that keeps growing as
you play. Fully client-side, works on any server.

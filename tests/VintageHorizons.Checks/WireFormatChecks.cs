/// One mod covers all four install combinations, so a 0.2.0 client can meet a 0.1.1
/// server and the reverse. Protobuf identifies a field by its number, not its name, so
/// renumbering a member or changing its type silently reinterprets an old peer's bytes.
/// The compiler cannot see it, the fast tier would not notice, and the symptom reaches a
/// player as garbled terrain or a handshake that fails for no stated reason.
///
/// So the numbers are asserted here rather than trusted. Adding a field with a NEW number
/// is safe and needs only a line below. Changing an existing number or type is a protocol
/// break, and this suite is where that decision gets made deliberately.

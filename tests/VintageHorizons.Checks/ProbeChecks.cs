/// Runs first, and exists only to fail loudly and specifically when the game assemblies
/// cannot be loaded.
///
/// Every other suite here is either pure BCL or touches game types so lightly that a
/// loading failure would surface as a confusing TypeInitializationException halfway
/// through an unrelated assertion. These two calls exercise the only two real loading
/// risks in the whole fast tier, so when they pass the rest is mechanically safe:
///
///   - Block: around two hundred virtual methods, and building its vtable resolves every
///     one of their signatures. That reaches further than any other type the checks touch.
///   - LodStore: overrides CreateTablesIfNotExists(SqliteConnection), so merely loading
///     the type forces Microsoft.Data.Sqlite to resolve, even though no database is opened.

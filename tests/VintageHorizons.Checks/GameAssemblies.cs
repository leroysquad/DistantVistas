/// and are referenced with Private=false so they never travel in the release zip. Copy-local
/// in this project's csproj handles the four direct references, but VintagestoryAPI.dll
/// names eight more in its own reference table (cairo-sharp, SkiaSharp, Newtonsoft.Json,
/// OpenTK x2, protobuf-net, System.Drawing.Primitives, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite). Which of
/// those actually load depends on which game types a check forces the CLR to build a vtable
/// for - Block alone has around two hundred virtual methods, and resolving their signatures
/// can reach almost anywhere.
///
/// Probing the install directly is one rule instead of a per-DLL guess list, and it keeps
/// working when the game adds a dependency.
